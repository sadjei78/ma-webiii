# üîí Security Guide for Mom's Contact Manager

## Overview
This contact management system is designed with multiple layers of security to ensure your data remains private and protected.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Firebase Authentication
- **Email/Password Login**: Secure authentication using Firebase Auth
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with Firebase
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters, enforced by Firebase
- **Account Creation**: Self-service account creation for family members

### Access Control
- **Private Repository**: GitHub repository is private, only accessible to you and family
- **Authenticated Access**: All data operations require valid authentication
- **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data (if implementing multi-user)

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Security

### Firebase Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only authenticated users can read/write contacts
    match /contacts/{contactId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Only authenticated users can read/write categories
    match /categories/{categoryId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Deny all other access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Encryption
- **In Transit**: All data is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS
- **At Rest**: Firebase automatically encrypts all data stored in Firestore
- **API Keys**: Firebase API keys are safe to expose in client-side code (they're designed for this)

## üåê Network Security

### HTTPS Enforcement
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatically serves over HTTPS
- **Firebase**: All connections use HTTPS by default
- **Mixed Content**: Blocked by modern browsers

### CORS Protection
- **Firebase**: Handles CORS automatically
- **Cross-Origin**: Limited to your domain only

## üì± Application Security

### Input Validation
- **Client-Side**: Real-time validation for all forms
- **Server-Side**: Firebase validates all data before storage
- **XSS Protection**: Content is properly escaped in templates

### Session Security
- **Automatic Logout**: Sessions expire when browser closes
- **Secure Storage**: No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- **Token Management**: Firebase handles authentication tokens securely

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, strong passwords
2. **Account Sharing**: Only share accounts with trusted family members
3. **Regular Logout**: Sign out when using shared devices
4. **Browser Security**: Keep browsers updated and use private browsing when needed

### For Administrators
1. **Repository Access**: Keep GitHub repository private
2. **Firebase Console**: Regularly monitor Firebase usage
3. **Security Rules**: Review and update Firestore security rules as needed
4. **Backup**: Regularly export contacts as backup

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Firebase Console
- Monitor authentication attempts
- Track database usage
- Review security rules
- Set up alerts for unusual activity

### GitHub Security
- Enable security alerts for dependencies
- Regular security updates
- Monitor repository access

## üîÑ Security Updates

### Automatic Updates
- **Firebase SDK**: Automatically updated via CDN
- **Bootstrap**: Latest version for security patches
- **Dependencies**: All external libraries are from trusted CDNs

### Manual Updates
- **Security Rules**: Update as needed
- **Authentication**: Add additional providers if needed
- **Backup**: Regular data exports
